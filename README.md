## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemclaren/claude-tasks/main/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest binary for your platform to `~/.local/bin/`.

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/kylemclaren/claude-tasks.git
cd claude-tasks

# Build
go build -o ai-tasks ./cmd/ai-tasks

# Run
./ai-tasks
```

### Requirements

- Go 1.24+
- [Claude CLI](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- SQLite (bundled via go-sqlite3)

## Usage

### CLI Commands

```bash
ai-tasks              # Launch the interactive TUI
ai-tasks version      # Show version information
ai-tasks upgrade      # Upgrade to the latest version
ai-tasks help         # Show help message
```

### Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `a` | Add new task |
| `e` | Edit selected task |
| `d` | Delete selected task (with confirmation) |
| `t` | Toggle task enabled/disabled |
| `r` | Run task immediately |
| `/` | Search/filter tasks |
| `Enter` | View task output history |
| `s` | Settings (usage threshold) |
| `?` | Toggle help / Cron presets (in cron field) |
| `q` | Quit |

### Cron Format

Uses 6-field cron expressions: `second minute hour day month weekday`

```
0 * * * * *      # Every minute
0 0 9 * * *      # Every day at 9:00 AM
0 30 8 * * 1-5   # Weekdays at 8:30 AM
0 0 */2 * * *    # Every 2 hours
0 0 9 * * 0      # Every Sunday at 9:00 AM
```

### Webhooks (Discord & Slack)

Add webhook URLs when creating a task to receive notifications:

**Discord:**
- Rich embeds with colored sidebar (green/red/yellow)
- Markdown formatting preserved
- Task status, duration, working directory

**Slack:**
- Block Kit formatting with rich layouts
- Markdown converted to Slack's mrkdwn format
- Timestamps and status fields

Both include:
- Task completion status (success/failure)
- Execution duration
- Output with markdown formatting
- Error details if failed

### Usage Threshold

Press `s` to configure the usage threshold (default: 80%). When your Anthropic API usage exceeds this threshold, scheduled tasks will be skipped to preserve quota.

The header shows real-time usage:
```
◆ AI Tasks  5h ████░░░░░░ 42% │ 7d ██████░░░░ 61% │ ⏱ 2h15m │ ⚡ 80%
```

## Configuration

By default the SQLite database lives at `~/.ai-tasks/tasks.db`. The
parent directory also holds the daemon PID file when running in daemon
mode.

Override the database path:
```bash
./ai-tasks --db /custom/path/tasks.db
```

The `--db` flag is accepted by every command (`ai-tasks`,
`ai-tasks daemon`, `ai-tasks serve`).
